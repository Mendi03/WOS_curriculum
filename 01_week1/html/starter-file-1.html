            Semantics is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with
            meaning. It focuses on the relationship between signifiers—like
            words, phrases, signs—and what they stand for.

          The word “semantics” comes from the Greek word <em>semantikos</em>,
          meaning “significant.” It was first used in the late 19th century to
          refer to the science of meaning in language.
