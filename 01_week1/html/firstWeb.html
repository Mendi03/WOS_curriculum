        Hello! I grew up in Mexico until I was 14. My mother's side of the family is in Mexico and my father's side is here in the U.S.

        I really want to make a videogame at some point. Definitely on the horror side. But the story has to be top notch

            One of my favorite websitess to visit is youtube, and a youtuber I enjoy watching is <strong style="color: blueviolet;">Summoning salt</strong>!
        </h3>
        <p>
            He makes videos about speedrunning history. My favorite is probably the one about Mike Tyson's Punchout, specifically, the video about how a single person held all the records for the game for years!!!
            <hr style="display: none;">
            The video should be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR9ypSOTGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here</a>. The title is <i>The Quest to beat Matt Turk</i>
